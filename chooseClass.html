            Hunters prowl the wilderness and wastelands, taking big risks 
            for even bigger rewards. You're no outlaw—at least, not anymore—but making
            your own luck has always meant bending the rules. Your unique brand
            of daring and ingenuity is needed now more than ever.

            The first Titans built the Wall, and gave their lives to defend it.
            Now, you stand in the same high place, steadfast and sure, protecting
            all who shelter in your shadow. You hail from a long line of
            heroes, forged from strength and sacrifice.
            Our enemies may be deadly and merciless, but so are you.

            Warlocks have long studied the Traveler, mastering some of its arcane energies.
            Its true purpose still remains a great mystery, but discovering
            truth has always driven you into the unknown. Now, our enemies are the
            only thing that stands between you and the lost wonders of our Golden Age.
