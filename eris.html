            Eris Morn is a former Hunter and sole survivor of the ill-fated attempt
            on Crota's life. She lost her Ghost, her Light and her friends to the Hive, and is eager to
            make them suffer as she once did. She played a major role in
            the death of Crota, as well as Oryx, Omnigul, and Hashladun.
        <p>
            Eris participated in the initial attempt to retake the Moon from the Hive,
            where hundreds of her fellow Guardians were slain by the Hive, who were
            led by Crota. After consulting with Eriana-3, they decided to seek out Toland,
            the Shattered for their plan to assassinate Crota. They also recruited the
            Hunters Sai Mota and Omar Agah, and the Titan Vell Tarlowe, bringing the
            total number of members of the fireteam up to six. In the end, however, she
            was the sole survivor of the fireteam, after they entered the Hellmouth,
            seeking to kill Crota, but were slaughtered by Crota and his armies.

            In the process, Crota somehow severed her connection to the Traveler,
            and took away her light. This gave her a dark, desolate appearance, of prominence
            being the green, three-eyed visage of the Hive. For years, Eris was
            forced to hide in the vast tunnels that the Hive dug in the Moon's surface,
            studying them and learning many, many secrets previously unknown to Earth.
            Eventually, she managed to construct a ship from scavenged material, and escaped the Moon.
