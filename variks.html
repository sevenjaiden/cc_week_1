    <h3>Variks is loyal to the Queen, and has no love for the Kells who have taken command of the Fallen Houses.</h3>

        <p>
            Variks, The Loyal is a Fallen Vandal and the only known surviving member of the House of Judgment.
            Variks served as the House of Judgment envoy to Skolas during the Reef Wars. 
            However, Variks was disturbed by Skolas' brutality, and after Skolas docked 
            him of his upper arms, he abandoned the Kell and joined the Reef. His betrayal 
            allowed the Queen to learn of Skolas' impending attack on Cybele, leading to Skolas' incarceration.
            After the House of Wolves rebelled against Queen Mara Sov, he remained loyal.

        <h4>Post Taken War</h4>
        <P>
            After the attack on Oryx's Dreadnaught and the disappearance of 
            both Mara and Uldren Sov, Variks became the de facto spymaster and commander 
            of the Reef's intelligence contingency, the Crows. He used them to look for 
            a suitable Fallen worthy of being the Kell of Kells to unite the Fallen.
        </P>
        <P>
            Years after the Taken War, Variks abandoned his position as Warden of 
            the Prison of Elders and released all of the prisoners within it. He used 
            this to recruit various imprisoned Fallen to join the House of Judgment, in an 
            attempt to reunite the Fallen houses and factions and return to the traditional ways of 
            the Eliksni. At the same time, he has also proclaimed himself as the 
            prophecised "Kell of Kells", who is supposedly destined to be chosen by the 
            Great Machine, and to reunite the Eliksni under their banner.
