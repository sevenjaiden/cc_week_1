<h1>Guardians</h1>    
    <p>
        All guardians act under one of three classes. Your class chooses you.
        It is through your character, your interests, and your modes of action in pushing back
        the darkness, will your identity as a guardian manifest itself.

    <h3>Notable Guardians</h3>
        <p>
            Many guardians have become famous - sometimes infamous - through their 
            incredible feats of power, strength, intellect, and bravery
            in writing and rewriting the history of the The Last City. These guardians became legends whose 
            stories were and will be spoken for generations. Through their exploits, they have 
            carved their names into humanity's long history of engagement and 
            riumph over its enemies. Those featured here, among many others, no matter the reason, held 
            pivotal roles in shaping the foundation for future guardians in their battle against the Darkness.
