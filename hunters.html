            The Hunter is a Guardian class that specializes in mobility,
            stealth, and marksmanship. Hunters are quick with a blade and
            quicker on the draw, and are known as the "Masters of the Frontier."
            Hunters have a well-earned reputation for enjoying spending time out
            of the wilds, which sometimes gets them into trouble with their commanding officers.

    <h3>History</h3>  
    <div>
        <p>
            Hunters were once survivors that roamed the wastelands and wilderness 
            making their own luck. Through manipulation of the Traveler's energies, 
            Hunters learned how to survive in the wild. This heritage has 
            led to their characteristic tendency of bending the rules to suit their particular situation.
            Though Hunters prefer working alone, others see the value of 
            working with other Guardians as part of a fireteam. Some fear them as 
            being too reckless and dangerous, but their bravery has led to many discoveries dating back to the Golden Age.
