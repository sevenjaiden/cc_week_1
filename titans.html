            The Titan is a Guardian class which specializes in armor.
            The first Titans built and defended The Wall that protects
            The City. Their heritage is rooted in strength, sacrifice, and mercilessness.

<h3>History</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Titans have long honed the Light of the Traveler, passing these
            skills to each new generation of warrior. Their strength gave birth to
            the City, and they have taken a blood oath to ensure it will
            always stand strong. The Wall surrounding the City
            was built by the first Titans, who also perished defending it.
