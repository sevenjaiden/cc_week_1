    <h3>Commander Zavala is the current Titan Vanguard of the Tower.
        <br>
        He is a leader with a will of iron and works tirelessly
        to keep the people of the City safe. He is partnered with the Ghost Targe.</h3>

        <p>
            Zavala was the Titan Vanguard at the time of the destruction of the
            Black Heart by the Guardian. As Vanguard Commander, Zavala is responsible
            for many of the campaigns and operations conducted by Guardians throughout system.
            <br>
            Zavala is seen a clear headed leader, someone who doesn't
            think without a second thought, he often finds himself putting the other vanguards
            in the tower in place, so you could say he is a responsible role-model. 
            During the Red War, Zavala was forced to escape to Titan with whatever 
            civilians he could, there he showed his dedication to the people of the
            Last City as he constantly puts their protection above all else.
