    <h1>The beings that inhabit the world of Destiny</h1>
    <h2>The Fallen</h2>
    <img src="fallen.webp" height = 300>
    <h3>"The Fallen are a scourge, tirelessly engaged in war against us and scavenging all that remains." - Unknown</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The Fallen, or Eliksni in their native language,
            are a nomadic species of four-armed bipedal humanoids.
            They are a race of pirates and mercenaries located on Earth, the Moon, Venus, The Reef, Mars, Nessus, Io, and Titan,
            and are one of the primary antagonist races in the Destiny series.
            The Fallen are an agile race with four arms, three fingers, and two legs, giving them 
            the ability to scale walls with ease.
            The race expresses a complex understanding of technology as they
            possess advanced armor, weapons, vehicles, and space-faring capabilities.
            They have the capability to speak Earth languages to varying degrees.
            <a href = "variks.html" target = "_blank">Variks</a>, a member of the House of Judgment, is one of the few to speak them fluently.
            The Fallen have four eyes that glow a bright white-blue when they are alive, but once killed, the light dies out. 
            In their mouths are two rows of sharp, knife-like teeth, indicating that the Fallen are
            carnivorous in nature. This is also implied from <a href = "saint14.html" target = "_blank">Saint-14</a> when he said he saw Dregs eating children.
            The Fallen are also capable of growing back their arms, as Dregs are allowed to develop their 
            lower two arms upon being granted the honor of becoming a Vandal.

    <h2>The Hive</h2>
    <img src = "hive.jpeg" height = 300>
    <h3>"That what can be destroyed, must be destroyed. What cannot be destroyed will surpass infinity."<br>
         - Savath√ªn, The Witch Queen</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            The Hive are an impossibly ancient race that battled humanity at the end of their Golden Age.
            They most prominently reside on the Moon, where they have burrowed deep
            within its lifeless core, carving out a kingdom for themselves. They have been silent and
            buried among many dark and terrible secrets, staying there for centuries while
            growing stronger. They serve as a reminder of the tremendous power that brought forth the Collapse.
            The Hive is an ancient species that traverse the stars in ships
            that act like sarcophagi, which have kept them alive by some magical means for millennia.
            The Hive will delve deep into a planetoid, unheeding of the damage they
            do in the process, crafting linked caverns and gothic-inspired columns.
            Their underground spaces are like a dungeon that has only recently been pulled up from too long underwater.
            They have existed for billions of years in service to the Worm Gods who gave
            them their abilities directly from the Formless One. In return for their service, the Worm Gods helped
            them escape the incoming Syzygy that was going to destroy their
            homeworld of Fundament. They follow a religion called the Sword Logic, which is an
            extreme form of Darwinism where only the strongest survive.

    <h2>The Cabal</h2>
    <img src = "cabal.webp" height = 300>
    <h3>"Go now and conquer our enemies, or forget that you ever called this place home." - Cabal General </h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Cabal, sometimes informally called "Space Rhinos," are a race of large
            bipedal humanoids located on Mars, Mercury, Nessus and The Reef.
            They are one of the primary antagonist species in the Destiny Series. The Cabal empire is
            a Massive military-industrial complex.
            Cabal are a large, rhinoceros-like, bipedal race with thick grey skin, a flat nose, conical teeth, and small eyes. 
            Despite being unable to breathe the Martian atmosphere without their
            armor, the Cabal appear to exhibit an affinity to desert-like terrain, which is evident
            through their colloquial nomenclature and occupation of Mars.
            The race expresses a complex understanding of technology, seen with advanced armor, weapons, vehicles, and the
            art of space-faring.
            Almost all Cabal technology contains an unknown
            black sludge that human laboratories have yet to find a way to
            synthesize. When killed, Cabal soldiers collapse loudly and "squirt dark oil from their livery."
            Their armor is pressurized and replicates the high-gravity conditions found
            on their homeworld. Judging by a Ghost's observations, they may have poor eyesight.

    <h2>The Vex</h2>
    <img src = "vex.jpeg" height = 300>
    <h3>"Evil so evil, it despises other evil" - The Exo Stranger</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The Vex are ancient metal warriors, linked together and governed by Axis Minds.
            Unlike most species, they don't understand hostility, as the species had a common threat on their planet. 
            As a result, what the beings found in the Solar System perceive as hostility
            is in reality simply the vex attempting to convert everything into something that makes sense to them.
            The Vex originated from before the beginning of the universe
            as highly tenacious patterns fleeing destruction at
            the battle fought outside of cause and effect. In the earliest epochs
            of the universe, the Vex existed as patterns in the primordial chaos, and later during
            the era of atomic matter rode comets down to young worlds and encoded themselves
            as a substrate of Radiolaria. From these primordial origins the Vex began to spread.
            The Vex appeared on Venus from an unknown location by way
            of transfer gates that allow them to instantly warp through worlds and time.
            All attempts to communicate with the Vex have failed, due to their single purpose to expand their
            species throughout the galaxy, commanded by Axis Minds that single-handedly control whole armies.
