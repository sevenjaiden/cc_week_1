            The Warlock is a Guardian class in Destiny that specializes
            in combining "magical" powers granted by The Traveler with modern weapons.
            Warlocks have long studied The Traveler, which gives
            rise to their ability to harness some of its powers. As the Warlocks advance
            through levels, their arcane powers grow stronger.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Warlocks were the first to tap into the power of the Traveler,
            wielding its Light as they ventured beyond the safety of the Wall.
            They know that each discovery offers new possibilities,
            and they have devoted themselves to understanding the Traveler, its
            power and how to better channel it. A Warlock's mind is an
            arsenal of deadly secrets, balanced between genius and madness.
            On the battlefield, those secrets can seem to shatter reality
            itself. They search the frontier to find a means to defeat the Darkness once and for all.
