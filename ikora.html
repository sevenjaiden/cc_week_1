    <h3>Respected among all, Ikora Rey tutors new Warlocks with a lifetime of hard-earned knowledge.</h3>

        <p>
            Ikora Rey is the Last City's current Warlock Vanguard, and is the
            second Warlock Vanguard overall. She took over the position from her
            former mentor, the legendary Warlock Osiris, upon his banishment
            from the city--though she had been performing the duties of the 
            anguard long before his banishment was made official.
        <p>
            Prior to taking on her role as Vanguard, Ikora flew solo 
            reconnaissance missions across the inner solar system and was known 
            for being outspoken. At that time, Invective was her weapon of 
            choice. She is also the only person to have ever beaten <a href = "shaxx.html">Lord Shaxx</a> 
            in a Crucible match.[6] Ikora was mentored by the Warlock Vanguard Osiris.

            Ikora Rey's personality has many layers to it. To some, she is 
            cold and analytical. To others, she is warm and caring. She has been 
            shown to be more light hearted than Commander Zavala, but not quite as lackadaisical as Cayde-6.
            She is a very introspective person, showing that in times of great distress (such as the Red War)
            she will question herself, and how she can be better.While outwardly 
            Ikora seems to be the type to overthink everything, according to her Ghost, 
            she is quite the opposite. Her Ghost often needs to act as a balancing force, 
            so that she does not act impulsively or out of emotional distress.
