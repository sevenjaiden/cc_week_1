                Saint-14 is an Exo and one of the most famous Titans in the history of The Last City.
                Partnered with the Ghost Geppetto, he served as the first Titan Vanguard and was the
                right hand of the Speaker. After the exile of Osiris and Saint-14's crusades against the Fallen,
                Saint-14 disappeared on a mission to Mercury to prevent Osiris from disturbing the Vex.
                He was later stripped of his Light by the Vex and perished in the Infinite Forest shortly
                after documenting his final notes to Osiris, the Speaker, and to The Guardian. However,
                he was spared this fate with the time-traveling intervention of the Guardian that served
                as his inspiration and has since returned to the City to
                oversee the Trials of Osiris at his old friend's request, to prepare the City for the coming Darkness.
