            <p>
                Shaxx is a hero of the Battle of Twilight Gap and led
                a counterattack against the Fallen that pushed them from
                The Last City's walls, along with Nkechi-32, Idil Abdi, Truce, Liu Feng and Ana Bray.
                He and Zavala were both proteges of Lord Saladin, however Shaxx's
                relationship with Saladin has become strained since the Battle
                of Twilight Gap. He is still on good terms with Zavala. 
                Shaxx now serves as <br> the head of the <a href = "crucible.html" target = "_blank">Crucible</a> in the City.
