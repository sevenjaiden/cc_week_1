                Destiny is an online first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. 
                It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles.
                Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it was
                the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision.
                Set in a "mythological science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer
                "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games.
                Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types.
                In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and six-player raids.
                A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events.
                PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.
                Players take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as
                 they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races.
