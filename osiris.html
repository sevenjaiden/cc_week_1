            Osiris is an old Warlock who was exiled from The City, due to his
            obsession with the Vex and the Infinite Forest, and was said to
            have "come too close" to understanding the Vex. He has knowledge about
            the inner working of the Hive, as he knew about the Shrine of Oryx.
        </p>    
        <p>
            The Titan Vanguard at the time, Saint-14, searched for Osiris after Osiris's exile, but was unsucessful.

            You were summoned by Ikora Rey, who shows you Sagira, Osiris's Ghost, and 
            shares a report that Vex activity has surged dramatically. You went to Mercury,
            where a member of the Followers of Osiris, Brother Vance, awaited your arrival. 
            Unfortunately, you were unable to enter the gateway that led to the Infinite Forest. 
            You then went to Earth to activate Sagira at an Osiris base, but the brothers there 
            were killed by Fallen before you arrived. Luckily, the ghost shell is revived when 
            the you got close to a certain book. Somehow, Sagira then merged with 
            your Ghost, taking control of him. You returned to Mercury, where 
            you were then able to pass through the gateway to the Infinite Forest. After you were 
            guided through preparation and a final battle with Panoptes, Osiris extended his appreciation.
