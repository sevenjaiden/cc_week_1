    <h3>Cayde-6 is an Exo who served as Hunter Vanguard.</h3>

        <p>
            Despite being a skilled Hunter, Cayde is often facetious
            and makes flippant remarks, even in the face of his own demise.
            However, when aggravated, he abandons his carefree demeanor and becomes
            more thoughtful and even vengeful. He remembers that when he was resurrected
            as a Guardian, he awoke to nothing but sadness, loneliness,
            and pain; the destroyed journal he kept of his life before
            becoming a Guardian is the only hint as to who he was.

            After the death of his friend, Andal Brask, at the hands
            of Taniks, the Scarred, Cayde took on the Vanguard Dare. To his regret, he lost
            the bet and was forced to accept the challenge of becoming the new Hunter Vanguard.

            During some of Cayde's travels, he hid away stashes of information, clues to the past,
            and leads on rare and exotic weapons. One of the items he had
            hidden away was a preserved 1883 copy of Treasure Island. 
            The book was hidden in the Speaker's personal library
            and contains drawings and notes from Cayde within the book.
